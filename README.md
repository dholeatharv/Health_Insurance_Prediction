# Health_Insurance_Prediction
This project is a basic implementation of linear regression to predict an individual's health status based on their age.

## Overview
The primary goal of this project is to demonstrate the application of linear regression for predicting health status. The project involves the following steps:

## Applying linear regression
Evaluating the model performance

## Model Details

### 1. Data Preprocessing
Handle missing values (if any).
Prepare data for training.

### 2. Model Training
Use simple linear regression to establish the relationship between age and health status.

### 3. Evaluation Metrics
Mean Absolute Error (MAE)
Mean Squared Error (MSE)
R-squared Score

### 4. Visualization
Create a scatter plot with a regression line to show the relationship between age and predicted health status.

## Usage
Open the Health_Prediction.ipynb file.
Run the cells sequentially to:
Load and explore the dataset.
Train the linear regression model.
Evaluate and visualize the results.
